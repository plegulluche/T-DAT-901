In terms of payouts, Wild.io is the fastest withdrawal online casino in Canada. Put simply, withdrawals are approved instantly.",
      " ",
      "\nWe conducted extensive research when reviewing the top instant withdrawal casinos in Canada. Here’s an overview of the key metrics we focused on:",
      "\nThis section delves a lot deeper into the research methods we discussed above. This will help you choose the best fast withdrawal casino in Canada for your requirements.",
      "Most Canadian casino sites offer fast deposits when using a debit/credit card or e-wallet. However, withdrawals aren’t treated with the same level of urgency. In fact, withdrawal requests often remain ‘pending’ for several days. Only when the casino site manually approves the payout will the funds be sent to your payment method.",
      "Therefore, when choosing an online casino, you’ll want to avoid platforms that have a manual payment process. For instance, Mega Dice, Lucky Block, and Betpanda.io have integrated blockchain technology into their platforms. This means that when players request a payout, it’s automatically processed.",
      "Wallet-to-wallet payments are not only secure but ultra-fast. Depending on the underlying blockchain, the cryptocurrencies should arrive in your private wallet in 0-10 minutes.",
      "If you can’t find the withdrawal time frames on the payments page, check the terms and conditions. Then search for ‘Withdrawal’ to find if there are any terms related to payouts.",
      "We mentioned earlier that the best instant withdrawal casinos in Canada offer a safe gambling experience. This is a non-negotiable metric, as there are many scam casinos operating online.",
      "The most effective way of staying safe is by using a regulated casino site.",
      "Moreover, if you’re planning to deposit cryptocurrencies to benefit from instant payouts, make sure the casino has solid security systems in place. It should keep the majority of client-owned funds in cold wallets. The balance can be kept in hot wallets, so that withdrawals can be honored instantly.",
      "Third-party software providers supply games to online casinos. However not all software providers can be trusted, so research in this department is also important.",
      "Examples of software providers that meet this criterion include NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, Play’n GO, Playtech, and Novomatic. Games from these providers can be found in Lucky Block, Mega Dice, BC.Game, and many other instant payout casinos discussed today.",
      "In contrast, unregulated software providers aren’t required to follow the same rigorous testing rules. This means there isn’t a way to know if the respective games are truly fair.",
      "Once you’ve researched software providers, the next step is to explore what casino games are available. The vast majority of instant withdrawal casinos in Canada offer slots. This usually includes Megaway slots, which offer thousands of paylines. Table games can also be found at most Canadian casino sites.",
      "We like providers that offer different versions of roulette, blackjack, and baccarat. For instance, Wild.io offers almost 100 variations of roulette. This includes European, American, and French roulette, all with software and live dealers.",
      "It’s also worth checking out blockchain-based games on BC.Game. Each gaming outcome, such as a round of blockchain, is determined by provably fair technology. Without getting technical, this means that games are guaranteed to be random and fair. Moreover, gaming outcomes can be verified on the blockchain.",
      "Many fast withdrawal casinos also offer sports betting. This means you can place bets on ice hockey, American football, baseball, soccer, rugby, and other popular sports. Ultimately, make sure you check what gambling markets are available before choosing an online casino.",
      "You’ll need to choose an instant withdrawal casino in Canada that aligns with your budget. At one end, casual players should choose a provider that has a small minimum deposit requirement. Lucky Block requires just 0.0001 BTC, which is about $5. This is an inconsequential amount for most Canadian players.",
      "High rollers, however, will need an instant payout casino that supports high betting limits. Moreover, there should be no caps on withdrawals. We came across many platforms that limit daily withdrawal amounts; these casinos should be avoided. If you’re a high roller, consider Mega Dice – no withdrawal limits are in place.",
      "If you’re comfortable providing an online casino with your personal information, government-issued ID, and proof of address (e.g. bank statement), then you’ll have plenty of options to choose from.",
      "That said, if you want to gamble anonymously without any KYC requirements, you’ll want to consider platforms like Lucky Block, Mega Dice, or BC.Game. These instant payout casinos do not have a KYC process, as they only handle cryptocurrency deposits. This means you can gamble anonymously.",
      "In addition, this will fast-track the sign-up process. After all, you only need to provide an email address and choose a password. You can then deposit cryptocurrencies and begin gambling within minutes.",
      "Bonuses remain an integral part of the online gambling space, especially with Canadians. Therefore, when choosing an online casino with fast payouts, make sure it offers a generous welcome package.",
      "You’ll get a huge 200% deposit bonus when joining Lucky Block. The maximum bonus is €10,000 or about $15,000. After you’ve claimed the Lucky Block welcome package you can move onto Mega Dice. Once again, the first deposit is matched by 200%. Only this time, the maximum bonus is 1 BTC, or about $50,000.",
      "BC.Game, Betpanda.io, Wild.io, and many other casinos listed on this page also offer generous welcome packages. Some of the things to consider before claiming a casino bonus:",
      "Casino bonuses aren’t just for first-time players. Some of the best Canadian casino sites also offer bonuses to existing accounts. This keeps players coming back for more, rather than joining another casino.",
      "Some of the best casino bonuses for existing players include:",
      "Just like welcome packages, ongoing bonuses also come with terms and conditions.",
      "It’s important to choose an online casino that is simple to use. After all, some casinos offer thousands of games, so there should be adequate filters. For example, casino games should be split by the gambling product, such as ‘table games’ or ‘slots’. There should also be a filter for software providers.",
      "The overall gaming experience should be enjoyable, meaning fast loading speeds. This is especially the case when playing live dealer games. For instance, we found that some live dealer feeds are a few seconds behind actual gameplay. This means gaming outcomes are revealed before you get to watch the action unfold.",
      "The best instant withdrawal casinos in Canada are available on desktop ",
      " mobile devices. The casino will optimize its platform for mobile web browsers, enabling players to gamble on a smartphone. Games will also be optimized by the respective software provider.",
      "This ensures that the gambling experience is still fun and enjoyable. Once again, this highlights the importance of choosing a casino that partners with reputable software developers. There should be no features missing when using the mobile platform; full functionality should be available.",
      "\nOnline casino payouts require players to manually request a withdrawal. It’s usually just a case of clicking the ‘Withdrawal’ button, typing in the amount, and then confirming. The withdrawal will then show as ‘Pending’. This is where things can become frustrating, as casinos need to manually approve the payout before the funds are processed.",
      "How long this takes will vary from one casino to the next. We found that it’s usually at least two working days. The casino will claim that it needs to verify all withdrawal requests for security purposes. In the meantime, players have the option of ‘Canceling’ the withdrawal, meaning the funds are put back into their casino account balance.",
      "All that being said, ",
      " has created a sea-change in how payouts are handled. This is because leading crypto casinos automatically approve withdrawals, meaning the funds are instantly transferred to the player’s private wallet. This reduces the payout time from days to minutes.",
      "This is because ",
      ", so there is less regulatory friction when processing withdrawals. This isn’t the case with traditional fiat payments.",
      "Irrespective of where the casino platform is based, fiat money withdrawals trigger KYC compliance checks. This is a legal requirement for all instant payout casinos, as they must comply with ",
      ". As such, if you want to gamble with Canadian dollars, you’ll need to first upload some government-issued ID before payouts are approved.",
      "\nMost online casinos ‘aim’ to process payouts within 1-2 working days. However, longer waits are common, especially if a large amount is being withdrawn. As we mentioned, your withdrawal will remain ‘Pending’ until the casino manually approves it. Until it’s processed, there is nothing you can do to speed it up.",
      "The only way to receive your winnings faster is by using an instant payout casino that specializes in cryptocurrencies. For example, Mega Dice approves payout requests instantly. This is also the case with Lucky Block and BC.Game. You simply need to paste your wallet address and the cryptocurrencies will be transferred straight away.",
      "The entire process is automated, so the funds should arrive in under 10 minutes. Our research shows that in a small number of cases, even cryptocurrency casinos might need a little bit more time to approve the payout.",
      "We found that this is usually because the player has requested a withdrawal to a new wallet address. Although this is permitted, the casino might want to make sure that the requested address is correct. After all, if the cryptocurrency tokens are transferred to the wrong wallet address, the casino won’t be able to help the player recover them.",
      "\nOnline gambling sites in Canada are known for slow and cumbersome payouts. Fortunately, there are many alternatives in the market that offer fast withdrawals.",
      "Overall, we found that Lucky Block is the fastest payout online casino in Canada. Not only does Lucky Block approve payouts instantly but it doesn’t have a KYC policy. Lucky Block offers thousands of games and new players will receive a generous welcome bonus with fair terms.",
      "All Canadian casinos must pay out when customers make a withdrawal. While most take 1-2 working days, Lucky Block offers instant payouts.",
      "Some of the most trusted casinos offering instant withdrawals include Lucky Block, Wild.io, Mega Dice, and Betpanda.io.",
      "Lucky Block offers thousands of high-payout games, with some offering RTPs of over 97%.",
