# First roadmap of the project

## Step 1: Environment Setup
* Docker and Docker Compose: Setup Docker and Docker Compose on your machine to containerize the services you'll use. This will ensure a smooth, consistent working environment.

* Development Environment: Setup your development environment with the necessary tools such as a code editor, Python environment, and other dependencies.

## Step 2: Data Collection

* **Python Scraper** :

Implement a simple Python script using a library like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to scrape headlines from a specified website.

Implement another scraper to fetch cryptocurrency values.

* **API Setup**:

If the website has an API, use requests library to make API calls instead of scraping.

## Step 3: Kafka Integration

* **Producer** : Create a Kafka producer in Python to send scraped data to Kafka topics.

* **Consumer** : Create a simple Kafka consumer to ensure data is being sent and received correctly.

## Step 4: Spark Cluster Setup

* **Spark Setup** : Setup a Spark cluster using Docker Compose.

* **Data Processing** : Implement a simplistic logic to process the data. For instance, count the number of occurrences of a particular word in the headlines.

## Step 5: React Application

* **React Setup** : Setup a basic React application.
* **Data Display** : Create a component to display the processed data from Spark.

## Step 6: Data Flow and Architecture Documentation

* **Diagram** : Draw a simple diagram to illustrate the data flow from scraping, to Kafka, to Spark, and finally to the React app.
* **Documentation** : Document the steps taken, challenges encountered, and how they were overcome.

## Step 7: Review and Feedback

At each step, share your progress, code, and any blockers you might be facing. Iâ€™ll review and provide feedback to ensure you're on the right track before proceeding to the next step.

## Step 8: Incremental Improvement

Once the basic setup is functioning as expected, we can discuss and implement incremental improvements to enhance the project further.
