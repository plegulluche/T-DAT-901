# Define the services (containers) that will be created
services:

  # Define the Spark Master service
  spark-master:
  
    # Image to use for creating this container
    image: bitnami/spark:latest
    
    # Environment variables for the container
    environment:
      - SPARK_MODE=master  # Set Spark to Master mode
      
    # Port mapping between host and container
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Map host's port 8080 to container's port 8080 for Web UI
    
    # Volume mapping to share a folder between host and container
    volumes:
      - "<your-working-dir-path>:/opt/bitnami/spark/work"  # Replace with your local directory
    
    # Network for this container
    networks:
      - bootstrap-spark-net  # Custom bridge network for inter-container communication

  # Define the Spark Worker service
  spark-worker:
  
    # Image to use for creating this container
    image: bitnami/spark:latest
    
    # Environment variables for the container
    environment:
      - SPARK_MODE=worker  # Set Spark to Worker mode
      - SPARK_MASTER_URL=spark://spark-master:7077  # URL of the Spark Master for this worker to connect to
      
    # Volume mapping to share a folder between host and container
    volumes:
      - "<your-working-dir-path>:/opt/bitnami/spark/work"  # Replace with your local directory
    
    # Network for this container
    networks:
      - bootstrap-spark-net  # Custom bridge network for inter-container communication
      
    # Specify that this service depends on another service
    depends_on:
      - spark-master  # Worker depends on the Master being up and running first

# Define custom networks
networks:
  bootstrap-spark-net:  # Custom bridge network name
    driver: bridge  # Use the default bridge network driver
